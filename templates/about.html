      <p class="mb-3">
        RE Marketplace connects real estate developers with professional investors in the secured
        short-term funding niche (USD $3–30M). Founded by former investment bankers with 50+ years of
        combined experience across structured funding, interest rates, credit and financial risk,
        we operate as a <strong>B2B intermediary</strong> — not a broker or investment adviser.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Our role is to streamline introductions, information flow, and coordination (including tri-party NDAs),
        so credible projects find the right capital more efficiently.

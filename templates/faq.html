  <!-- Registration & Roles -->
  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Who can register as a developer?</h5>
    <p>Developers with a verifiable track record in residential, commercial, or mixed-use projects.</p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Who can register as an investor?</h5>

  </div></div>
  
    <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
      <h5>Who can view projects?</h5>
      <p>Registered investors can browse full details and documents. Public visitors can only view high-level information on the homepage.</p>
    </div></div>


  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Is the platform regulated as a financial intermediary?</h5>
    <p>    No. RE Marketplace operates as an <strong>information and introduction platform</strong>. 
    We do not provide investment advice, arrange or broker deals, hold client money, or distribute securities. 
    All engagement and transactions occur directly between developers and investors following bilateral agreement.</p>
  </div></div>


  <!-- Project & Process -->
    <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
      <h5>What’s the typical project duration?</h5>
      <p>
        Most opportunities are between <strong>3 and 24 months</strong>, depending on the construction stage and expected exit timing. Developers specify an indicative IRR and exit strategy during upload.
      </p>
    </div></div>
 
  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>What qualifies as a secured project?</h5>
    <p>
      Projects with collateral such as property, land, or first/second-charge security.
      QS (Quantity Surveyor) reports typically support cost control, progress valuation, and risk tracking.
    </p>
  </div></div>
  
   <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
     <h5>Can investors contact developers directly?</h5>
      <p>
        Initial contact occurs through the platform. Once mutual interest is confirmed, 
        the parties can agree to share further information via a tri-party NDA coordinated by the platform.
      </p>

   </div></div>
 
  
  <!-- NDA & Confidentiality -->
  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>What is the tri-party NDA process?</h5>
  <p>
    When an investor expresses interest in a project, they may request to sign a <strong>tri-party non-disclosure agreement</strong> 
    between the <em>Developer</em>, the <em>Platform</em>, and the <em>Investor</em>. 
    Once signed, the developer can share confidential information such as financial model, Quantity Surveyor (QS) reports, title documents and planning details securely.
  </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Does the NDA grant investment rights?</h5>
  <p>
    No — the NDA only governs confidentiality and information access. 
    Any subsequent investment decision, term sheet, or legal agreement is negotiated directly between the developer and investor.
  </p>
  </div></div>
  
  
   <!-- Platform Operations -->
  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>What fees are charged?</h5>
  <p>
    Registration is free for both developers and investors. 
    RE Marketplace may charge a service or facilitation fee for certain introductions or data access — these are agreed transparently and in writing before any engagement.
  </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>How is project information verified?</h5>
  <p>
    Developers are responsible for the accuracy of their submissions. 
    RE Marketplace performs basic plausibility checks but does not conduct full due diligence or guarantee completeness.
  </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Data & privacy</h5>
  <p>
    We use role-based access and all information is stored securely. Only owners (or admins) can edit or modify  projects.</p>
  </div></div>


  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>How is data stored and protected?</h5>
  <p>
    All uploaded files are stored securely with access restricted by user role. 
    Developers retain ownership of their materials. 
    We comply with applicable data protection laws and do not sell or share user data with third parties.
  </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Can projects be edited or removed?</h5>
  <p>
    Yes. Developers can edit or withdraw their own projects at any time. 
    Admins may remove listings that breach content or eligibility standards.
  </p>
  </div></div>


  <!-- Investor Experience -->
  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>How do investors search for projects?</h5>
  <p>
    Investors can filter projects by location, risk level, IRR, security type, or duration. 
    Summaries are visible to all registered investors, with additional details released once an NDA is in place.
  </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="card mb-3"><div class="card-body">
    <h5>Can multiple investors participate in a single project?</h5>
  <p>
    Potentially, yes — where a developer is open to co-investment or syndication. 
    Such arrangements are managed outside the platform and coordinated directly between the parties.
  </p>

  <h1 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <!-- Registration & Roles -->
  <h5>Who can register as a developer?</h5>
  <p>
    Developers with a verifiable track record in residential, commercial, or mixed-use real estate projects. 
    Profiles should include key company details, team experience, and a summary of past projects. 
    Developers must be corporate entities rather than individuals.
  </p>

  <h5>Who can register as an investor?</h5>
  <p>
    Institutional and professional investors, including family offices, private credit funds, and 
    corporates seeking secured short-term real estate exposure. 
    The platform is strictly <strong>B2B</strong> — we do not accept retail investors.
  </p>

  <h5>Is the platform regulated as a financial intermediary?</h5>
  <p>
    No. RE Marketplace operates as an <strong>information and introduction platform</strong>. 
    We do not provide investment advice, arrange or broker deals, hold client money, or distribute securities. 
    All engagement and transactions occur directly between developers and investors following bilateral agreement.
  </p>

  <!-- Project & Process -->
  <h5>What qualifies as a secured project?</h5>
  <p>
    Projects supported by identifiable collateral such as property, land, or development assets. 
    Security may take the form of a first or second legal charge, debenture, or corporate guarantee. 
    The security position and sponsor equity are clearly disclosed for each listing.
  </p>

  <h5>What’s the typical project duration?</h5>
  <p>
    Most opportunities are between <strong>3 and 24 months</strong>, depending on the construction stage and expected exit timing. 
    Developers specify an indicative IRR and exit strategy during upload.
  </p>

  <h5>Can investors contact developers directly?</h5>
  <p>
    Initial contact occurs through the platform. Once mutual interest is confirmed, 
    the parties can agree to share further information via a tri-party NDA coordinated by the platform.
  </p>

  <!-- NDA & Confidentiality -->
  <h5>What is the tri-party NDA process?</h5>
  <p>
    When an investor expresses interest in a project, they may request to sign a <strong>tri-party non-disclosure agreement</strong> 
    between the <em>Developer</em>, the <em>Platform</em>, and the <em>Investor</em>. 
    Once signed, the developer can share confidential information such as financial model, Quantity Surveyor (QS) reports, title documents and planning details securely.
  </p>

  <h5>Does the NDA grant investment rights?</h5>
  <p>
    No — the NDA only governs confidentiality and information access. 
    Any subsequent investment decision, term sheet, or legal agreement is negotiated directly between the developer and investor.
  </p>

  <!-- Platform Operations -->
  <h5>What fees are charged?</h5>
  <p>
    Registration is free for both developers and investors. 
    RE Marketplace may charge a service or facilitation fee for certain introductions or data access — these are agreed transparently and in writing before any engagement.
  </p>

  <h5>How is project information verified?</h5>
  <p>
    Developers are responsible for the accuracy of their submissions. 
    RE Marketplace performs basic plausibility checks but does not conduct full due diligence or guarantee completeness.
  </p>

  <h5>How is data stored and protected?</h5>
  <p>
    All uploaded files are stored securely with access restricted by user role. 
    Developers retain ownership of their materials. 
    We comply with applicable data protection laws and do not sell or share user data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h5>Can projects be edited or removed?</h5>
  <p>
    Yes. Developers can edit or withdraw their own projects at any time. 
    Admins may remove listings that breach content or eligibility standards.
  </p>

  <!-- Investor Experience -->
  <h5>How do investors search for projects?</h5>
  <p>
    Investors can filter projects by location, risk level, IRR, security type, or duration. 
    Summaries are visible to all registered investors, with additional details released once an NDA is in place.
  </p>

  <h5>Can multiple investors participate in a single project?</h5>
  <p>
    Potentially, yes — where a developer is open to co-investment or syndication. 
    Such arrangements are managed outside the platform and coordinated directly between the parties.
